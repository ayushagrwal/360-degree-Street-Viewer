It's a website which shows 360 degree street view of the place where you click on the map. I've used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to make this project.
Firstly, I divided the screen vertically in half. Left side of the screen shows map and coordinates (displayed as points) and Right side of the screen shows the corresponding 360 image. For coordinate information, I used sample.txt file in which the data is written in GeoJSON Format. I used OpenLayers for this task. On Click of any coordinate, it opens the corresponding 360 degree images in right screen. I've used panolens.js library for this task.
I've deployed it on GitHub Pages.
