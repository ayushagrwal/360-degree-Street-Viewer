# 360-degree-Street-Viewer
A website which shows 360 degree street view of the place where you click on the map.

I've used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to make this website.
Firstly, I divided the screen vertically in half. Left side of screen shows map and coordinate (displayed as points). For coordinate information, I used sample.txt file in which the data is written in GeoJSON Format. I used OpenLayers for this task. On Click of any coordinate, it opens the corresponding 360 images in right screen. I've used panolens.js library for this task.
