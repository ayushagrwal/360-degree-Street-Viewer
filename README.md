# 360-degree-Street-Viewer


This website provides a 360-degree street view of any location you click on the map. To develop this project, I utilized JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Openlayers, Panolens.js library.<br>
Initially, I divided the screen into two vertical halves, with the left side displaying the map and coordinates in point format, and the right side displaying the corresponding 360-degree image. To obtain the coordinate information, I referenced the sample.txt file, which contains data in GeoJSON Format, and incorporated OpenLayers to facilitate this process.
Upon clicking on a coordinate, the corresponding 360-degree image will be displayed on the right side of the screen. To achieve this functionality, I implemented the panolens.js library. The website has been deployed on GitHub Pages for ease of access.
